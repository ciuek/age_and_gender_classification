This mobile app allows user to scan face, either from gallery or camera, and use DL model to predict age and gender of a given pearson. DL model used in this project is [SSR-Net](https://github.com/shamangary/SSR-Net) trained on [IMDB-Wiki dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/). The model was converted to TFLite, and runs directly on the device. This project was my BEng thesis.
